**Import Export in React** 

So there are mainly two types of export 
-> **named export =** used when need to export specific function, variable, object etc
                 **TO import this you need to use the exact name of the variable, object or function also you need to use curly braces {}**
like     import {user} from './app.js'

-> **default export =** it is special we can only have one default export in the entire file 
                 **Advantages = you can use any name to import that no curly braces needed**

like     import user from './app.js'
