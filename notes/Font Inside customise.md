**background-clip: text;**

**color: transparent;  //** this one is also a important step to work this property



suppose now you use anything like background-gradient and background-image and use this property then the image or gradient will apply on the text

**you can also use video in the font but you can only use gif for that simple**
background-image: url\*(paste the gif url here);\*



**suppose you want to cover the text with the color like in word  *hello*  you want to make a border of h around all sides it needs a special property**

**-webkit-text-stroke: 3px red;   //**its like border property but not include solid like stuff
